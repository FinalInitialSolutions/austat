# AuStat - What do you know about Australia?

AuStat is a fun quiz that presents you with a question and a selection of locations or areas in Australia, one of which is the correct answer.
The datasets all have geospatial components and so the possible answeres are shown on a map.
The idea of the project is a fun competitive way to test your knowledge and educate yourself with facts about the available topics. Topics could range from indigenous, demograhpics, regional, cultural diversity, cost of living and can be added to as new data becomes available or accessable.
The aim is to get a top score that you can share and compare with your friends.
The intention is that statistics on corect and incorrect results could be kept for them used for research purposes. Public perception reseach could also be commissioned. 

This project started as a [GovHack](https://www.govhack.org/) 2015 entry, a working copy is available [here](http://austat.gordcorp.com:8080/)

##Enhancement Ideas

* Stored user score keeping rather than in memory IP based
* Social media integration
* Topic aware difficulty rating (number of points and similarity in results)
* Click on an area game mode where given multiple choice of a single stat for those interested in specific areas
* Keep anonymised answers so data owners and government communication teams can see public perception
* Link answers to dataset and importance of specific statistics
* More data with options based on knowledge of the data set and what story it can tell
* Rounds
* Mobile App
* Query APIs rather than the current csv copy based approach.
